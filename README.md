## What is this thing?
Roton is an emulation of the ZZT and Super ZZT game creation engines written in C#.

## Build instructions
Use Visual Studio 2013 or later. There are no special instructions, nor is there anything additional you need to install.
As long as you have at least version 4 of the .NET framework, you should be good to go.

## Where can I get more information about ZZT?
Visit http://zzt.org - the original game engines are available for download, as are some games to play on it.
